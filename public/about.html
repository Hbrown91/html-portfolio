<br/>
<p>My birth certificate says my name is Helen, but if you ask anybody who knows me, they'll all tell you it's Lisi. 
  I may be a budding web developer now, but the journey here wasn't exactly a linear one. I grew up in a house with my grandfather, an old software developer who served in vietnam, and when I was about eight years old, when I expressed an interest in his work, he simply handed me a copy of "HTML for Dummies" and told me to read it.
  I ended up with an overworked brain, a simple white page that read "Hello World", and a lot of pride, but... that was the end of it. <br/>
  
  <p>Without a proper tutor, I ended up letting it lie. Not much later, "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" became a massive phenomenon across the country, and my interests turned literary. Those interests are still as strong today as they were when I was a little girl; it's a lifelong love. 
  Over the course of my life, I've dabbled in poetry, self-published four fantasy novels (none of which are still on the web; I decided to keep them on my private bookshelves) and wrote a bit of fanfiction, but the tides turned a few years after the death of my grandfather.</p>
</p>

<p>I moved around a lot, but one of the things that was non-negotiable, that had to come with me was my grandfather's computer. It was seeing it one day, stowed away in the back of my closet, that made me think it was time to get back to the beginning--the curiosity of that eight-year-old-child--and attempt coding one more time. 
  And I did. Sure enough... one properly completed, well-done project was all it took to leave me hooked. I started with HTML, I'm moving on to CSS, and then JavaScript. I have a long way to go, but I'm excited to see where this journey takes me.
