<h1>The Best 3 movies according to Lisi</h1>
<h2>(That aren't part of a 3+ film series)</h2>
<hr /> 
<h3> 1) Interstellar</h3>

<p> This comes to mind first because it was really that thought-provoking. A dying Earth, a strained and broken family because of a father's love for the stars, the aftermath in a broken family, and, most important of all, the theory of relativity where we see the next generation solve problems that the previous generation couldn't... so many messages and thoughts to ponder on long after the movie's over. It's truly a masterclass in storytelling.</p>
<h3>2) The Last Witch Hunter</h3>

<p>I always end up loving anything that Vin Diesel plays in, and it truly was a fantastic movie. Following the story of Kaulder, an immortal witch hunter working with a secret society within the Catholic church. He comes across a witch named Chloe, who owns a bar, while in search of a way to access buried memories after the decalred death of his close friend, Dolan 36th. From there, the story takes Kaulder, Chloe, and Dolan 37th deeper and deeper into Kaulder's past, uncovering several surprises and betrayals that inevitably make one priest being out of commission the whole world's problem... and bring Kaulder and Chloe closer. As much as I <i>loved</i> this movie, I think the icing on the cake for me was when I heard that this movie was entirely based on Vin Diesel's actual D&D campaign. If this movie were a book, I'd binge read it. Hands down.</p>
<h3>3) Top Gun</h3>

<p> This makes the top three because, despite not being much of a movie-watcher, the character of Maverick isn't one that I'm going to forget anytime soon. We follow Pete "Maverick" Mitchell's journey. A reckless, devil-may-care pilot who doesn't take much of anything seriously (except his friendship with "Goose"), he enters an elite school for naval fighter pilots.<br/>
    We see him crash and burn in his first flirting attempts with Charlie, an astrophysicist who turns out to be one of his instructors. We also watch his rivalry with a classmate who calls himself "Ice Man", become an ongoing thing throughout most of the film, along with the class-wide race to earn the Acadamy's ranking honor, Top Gun.<br/> 
    At the end of Maverick's journey, where he finds himself humbled via personal tragedy that nearly makes him retire, Maverick's personal brand of reckless flying proves to be exactly what it takes to pull him and another classmate through real dangers that nearly cost them their lives. At the end, Maverick proves to have learned the meaning of unity... with his own personal flair. Overall, this turned out to be a study in how to make a character-driven story that is worth coming back to.</p>
